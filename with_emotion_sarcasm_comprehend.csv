I am stuck with 2.2 pounds. I have taken to mixing a tablespoon of powder with a teaspoon of lemon curd to try to diminish the unpleasant  flavor. Then I mix this with a serving spoon of plain yogurt.  Edible but not yummy.  I suppose this would work in some baked Items but I am not going to try it.  The chia seeds really curbed my appetite.

Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity.

The product is great when my baby was around 4 to 7 months, but her nutritional needs greatly increased by nine months.

Now, I have to use it everyday, which is okay if I had the time.  However coming home from work, sometimes, I just want to prepare  frozen foods quickly.

There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.

A good benefit is there wasn't a nasty smell to the treat before or after the dog eating it like there is with other dental-type pet treats.<br /><br />One thing I want to point out is the size of these treats - they are a lot bigger than a greenie and other similar pet dental treats, as well as a lot tougher which will take them longer to chew.  I have a small dog that weighs a little over ten pounds, so I broke this one in half which seemed like enough for him.<br /><br />See my tongue-in-cheek comment above about not tasting them, but I do believe there is a bit of salt in these, as a few hours after eating them he was extremely thirsty.<br /><br />Overall, this appears to be a good treat for your dog - time will tell if it helps his teeth!",positive,45,54,0.9891,positive,positive,disgust,normal,POSITIVE

I ordered it last Tuesday, and had it on Friday.  I was wary of ordering from them (found them Googling, looking for coupons), but they had a lot of recent positive reviews so I took a chance, and was very pleasantly surprised.  The model I got was the current B145 model, complete with an 18-pack sampler of K-cups.  Set-up was a breeze -- there was a quick set-up guide that walks you through what to do; I was drinking my first cup of coffee within 5-10 minutes of taking the maker out of the box.  : )<br /><br />When you register your machine with Keurig, they send you a code so if you buy 2 boxes of K-cups, you get 2 free.  I ended up with 4 boxes, plus 3 samplers for $39.05 (free shipping, because my original order was over $45).  The Keurig website is a great place to go to see ALL the K-cups offered -- over 200 of them.  Plus they sell samplers that contain 5 K-cups for around $3 -- a great way to be able to test obscure flavors (like Southern Pecan) without buying a whole box.  There are a lot of customer reviews there too, just like Amazon, which was really helpful.  (That's where I got the idea of running a K-cup through twice.)  The prices are comparable with Amazon's but with the free Prime shipping, I think Amazon wins out.  Still, it's a good place to get flavors that Amazon doesn't offer.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.  Now I can have a fresh cup of coffee whenever I want, and I don't end up having to throw out the occasional half-a-pot.  And it's so convenient compared to making a pot of coffee -- no filters to worry about, no loose coffee grinds, no washing the pot, the different flavors, etc.  I love my new toy!  : )",positive,1,63,0.9987,positive,negative,joy,de,POSITIVE

I can't have dairy, so before I placed my order, I checked its product page both on Amazon and on Back to Nature's own website for any milk, butter, etc. listed in the ingredients.  Everything cleared (yay!), so I went ahead and ordered it.<br /><br />While waiting for the granola to arrive, I perused the reviews on this page just to see what others thought about it.  For the most part, it sounded delicious and that everyone had enjoyed it.  But at least one person had listed ""skim milk"" among the ingredients, and upon reading this, my alarm bells went off.  Surely Back to Nature's own website would list the correct ingredients of their product, right?  Upon receiving my granola yesterday, I immediately flipped to the back of the package -- and wouldn't you know it, clearly listed (as part of the chocolate chunks) is nonfat milk.<br /><br />I don't know if Vine Voices were given a beta product, or perhaps Back to Nature changed their recipe and wanted to get rid of their backstock.  Which information source are we supposed to believe, the product packaging or the company website?  This mislabeling won't be an issue for most people, but it is a risk for those who are lactose intolerant or who otherwise don't consume dairy.<br /><br />Mislabeled or not, I wasn't willing to chance it, so I skipped eating the chocolate pieces but still ate the plain oat clusters.  It was very sweet and oaty, like a decadent ""dessert-type"" granola -- similar to Quaker Chewy bars, except not as moist.  I ate a few handfuls out of the bag but found it too dry; it was much more palatable eaten in a bowl with soymilk over it.  I do think it would be nice in an oatmeal cookie mix or over yogurt.  Although this granola has a pleasant flavor, mouthfeel, and crunch, I have tasted better and would rate this fairly average.<br /><br />Looking down into my bag when I was done with the oat clusters, I noticed that the chocolate pieces are all very tiny, flat, brick-shaped flakes -- instead of asymmetrical, craggly, varyingly-sized chunks.  I don't know why I was expecting the latter, but obviously it wasn't a big deal since I didn't eat them. :)<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice-tasting average granola.  You wouldn't be doing yourself a disservice by purchasing this -- it's tasty -- but there is better granola out there.  If you can't have dairy, you may want to opt for another variety/flavor just to be safe.",neutral,2,216,0.9913,positive,positive,joy,normal,POSITIVE

At the beginning I fed a variety of ""high end"" kibbles and canned food like Orijen, Solid Gold, Merricks etc. She would have runny poop, crusty eyes and was never that into her food generally, she would not always eat it all, and I didn't like the idea of all the processing, the 5 million ingredients and I have general distrust of pet food manufacturers after all the recalls and problems there have been.<br /><br />When we switched to home cooked things got better, but when we switched to raw it was amazing! She very rarely has any issues at all (except when she eats a take out menu that comes under the door or something!), her coat is beautifully soft and shiny, lots of energy, perfect weight, no eye goop. I feed Sojo's very frequently, usually with beef, and alternate with various brands of ground raw patties like Stella and Chewy's, Primal, Nature's Variety, and whole raw chicken bones, and various organ meats, raw eggs, canned sardines (no salt packed in water), occassional healthy human leftovers like fruits, veggies, yogurt etc. I have also tried The Honest Kitchen mixes, which are good too, but I can tell that she likes Sojo's more. She will sit in the kitchen the whole time I am preparing a batch sniffing the air and getting excited. I mix up a big batch at once and store in pre-measured containers of four serves (two meals per day) in the freezer and thaw one in the fridge at a time. Sojos is very easy to use, even with the change to the calcium I do not find it especially messy and it is important to shake the bag before use to get an even distribution of all the ingredients. I have ordered it from Amazon and also from their own website (where shipping is also free) and have always found their customer service to be great.

We tried everything, but still he wouldn't eat.  We went for a couple of weeks like this.  We started worrying and even took him to the shelter/vet and asked what we should do.  They only said, ""don't worry, he will ear eventually.""  We tried everything from Eukanuba, to Science diet, you name it we probably tried it.  We ended up with a cupboard full of bags that had less than a cup of food taken out of each.  He eventually started eating a little, I guess just enough to have something in his stomach, but not nearly the amount he should be eating.  It was pretty stressfull, as this was our first time actually owning a dog.  It got to the point where we'd walk him, and people would comment about how skinny he was.  Sad, I know.<br /><br />Finally someone recommended we try Wellness.  Now, I will say that we were a little hesitant at first, because it was a bit on the pricey side.  And we really didn't know that much about pet food.  We figured, you know, he's a dog, so long as he's not eating table scraps, it shouldn't matter that much (read: we were very ignorant).  Boy were we wrong, and since then, we've come a long way.  After checking out the Wellness site and really doing some research, we decided that it was worth it.  So we bought a little bag to, you know, try it out.  Just in case Nero didn't like it.  To our surprise, he loved the stuff!  Scarfed it down like I've never seen him do before.  My boyfriend and I both stood there silently while we watched him eat a whole bowl of food for the first time.<br /><br />Needless to say, after that we went online and bought a whole 30-pound bag.

I've tried virtually all artificial and low/no-calorie sweeteners, and they either taste horrible or give me gastric distress.<br /><br />My wife also loves iced tea, but not as sweet as I do, so we came up with a system for sweetening on demand.  As any of you iced tea aficionados out there probably know, normal granulated table sugar will not dissolve in cold tea, and it's easiest to sweeten the tea when it's hot just after brewing, but then the sweetness level is set for that batch.<br /><br />So, what we do is create a simple syrup consisting of 1 part organic evaporated cane juice sugar, 3 parts of this organic raw agave syrup, and 2 parts hot water.  We put those in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCDE52"">NALGENE Tritan 1-Quart Narrow Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle</a>, shake it up for a minute, and voila, a very sweet liquid that we store in the fridge next to the tea.  Then, when we pour a glass of tea we splash some of the syrup in it to taste, and it mixes up nicely even in the cold tea.<br /><br />And the taste of this agave sweetener is excellent.  It is not exactly like table sugar, it has a hint of a molasses or dark brown sugar flavor, but only a hint, and nothing 'artificial' or 'aftertaste'-y.<br /><br />And, yes, I know this is still sugar with empty calories, but I try to use it in moderation and figure that the lower glycemic load of agave is better than full-on refined table sugar, and the fact that both ingredients are organic make me feel better about it as well.",positive,11,169,0.9825,positive,negative,fear,normal,MIXED

The Starbucks mocha Frapachinos (bottled) are usually the only coffee-esque drink that I like, and even those I only drink a few times a year. The illy issimo Cappuccino wasn't bad - it wasn't nearly as creamy as the Starbucks drinks, but it was also around a half of the calories, so there's a bit of give and take there. It's also not super sweet - many of the Starbucks drinks border on that thin line between really tasty and ""The sugar is melting my teeth"". The illy issimo is very safely stashed on the not-super-sweet side of the fence. Don't take that to mean there isn't any sweetness - I'd compare it to a Symphony chocolate bar versus a Hershey's milk chocolate bar. They both have very similar flavor profiles, but the generic Hershey bar is so much sweeter. I can't really say it's like a dark chocolate either, because the cappuccino didn't have a lot of the bitter undertones that the dark chocolates and espresso drinks tend to have.<br /><br />As for energy burst, I should preface by saying that I'm not much of a caffeine drinker any more. My normal drink is straight water, and at restaurants iced tea (unsweet). I think my body has stored up reserves of caffeine and sugar from my childhood days though - back when I drank a six-pack (or more) of Coke a day. That being said, the ""rush"" from the drink took a few hours for me to feel it (granted I had already eaten lunch and had a full stomach, which might explain the lag). But when it hit, it was a sort of ""giddy"" high, not like a super pixie-stick rush.

Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models.

Stevia has been a bit controversial, as it was banned in 1991 by the FDA(but isn't anymore) and now is ban in Europe and a few other locations. But the reasons for banning are vague and don't seem completely investigated, just that there was ""pressure from the market"" to stamp them as unsafe.<br /><br />It was important to me that it be natural, because I go as much organic/natural as possible. I knew I wouldn't be using a boat load of it, so I'm not concerned about the controversy. I compared a couple of the stevia based sweeteners in price at the grocery store and this won out as my first to try. To be honest, it's pretty darn good! From a picky taster to you, this is worth giving a try. Dipping my finger in it, it has a cool(as in, cold)super sweet taste. I'm using 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of sugar in my coffee, and this was about 1/2 a packet or less to make it how I like it. I've only put it in my ice coffee so far, but I'm not noticing a huge taste difference between this and my usual sugar, which is great. No after taste to speak of.

This evergreen leaf is known for its pleasantly stimulating effect and for evoking a cheerful mental lucidity. We are proud to introduce this delightful tasting infusion of organic Mate with the Australian rainforests' organic Lemon Myrtle, touted as herb of the millennium for its high citral content. Organic Chun Mee green tea, skillfully hand-rolled into the eyebrow contour of its name, unfolds a subtle, plum-like sweetness to the leafy lemon piquancy of Mate and Myrtle. This energizing blend uplifts one's senses, as clarity arrives like birdsong after fresh rain.""

I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest ""tea ceremony"" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less ""green"" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my ""working"" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my ""too much coffee"" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any.

He consumed it within 3 minutes. Then about 20-30 minutes later, we had a BIG PROBLEM. He went into a seizure - both of his rear legs locked up, he was flailing his front legs around trying to get back up, his heart was pounding, he was panting heavily, had his teeth clenched, he was heavily salivating, and he defacated. He finally started to act relaxed, and then his eyes lost all life - I thought I was watching my dog die in front of me.<br /><br />Luckily, this event subsided, and he went back to normal. About 30 minutes after the seizure, he had a full bowel movement. Later, he ate a regular dinner and had another regular bowel movement, so that told me it wasn't a blockage. He is only 3 yrs old and strong as an ox (85 lb Collie), I have my doubts that it could be epilepsy or a brain tumor. I think he had a severe allergic reaction to the kelp and chlorophyl contained in the snack, or possibly that particular bag was tainted somehow. The sell-by date was good.

I am a huge fan of Izze Sparkling Juice and figured this would be similar to that.  It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.<br /><br />TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.<br /><br />BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.<br /><br />VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.

504487,B007I7YZJK,A70NFM6KHU24F,Trevor Burnham,4,7,1,1337299200,Don't be fooled,"There's a stark disconnect between the front of the product's packaging (which promises ""Iced Green Tea"" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.<br /><br />The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DHE"">Sugar Free Kool-Aid</a>, but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got ""no aspartame""--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this ""tea mix,"" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.<br /><br />Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness (""natural flavors,"" ""made with real ingredients,"" ""tea & honey,"" ""real fruit flavors"") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: ""sweetened with honey."" Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as ""Honey granules (sugar, honey),"" which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).<br /><br />So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton.",negative,26,360,0.9914,positive,negative,neutral,de,NEGATIVE

So although you could use this product for weight loss,  you wont be getting the vitamins and minerals that regular Chocolate Muscle Milk has.<br /><br />It is up to you, but you might want to email the company and ask if they can send you a sample of the product before jumping into spending a lot of money for a large container.

It's a single barrel selection with the barrel and rick numbers on each neck label served up at 101 proof to keep most of the cask goodness intact.  I was expecting it to be good.  It exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />In the glass it's a dark coppery bronze color.  The nose is rich and complex and evolves strikingly through time.  Time is a big factor here.  This stuff is 101 proof and has a lot of alcohol to disperse.  Initially, the aroma of butter - as in brown butter and buttered corn is striking.  As it opens up, sweeter sherry, treacle, pecan pie, citrus and floral notes join in.  It's a positively delicious aroma.  First sip shows a toffee sweetness that explodes across the palate with apple flower, toffee frosting, maple candy, citrus spritz and vanilla oak.  It's a paradise of plant esters in a distilled spirit.  Finish is long and complex with unfolding layers of aged sawn wood, perfumed sweetness, bitter orange/dark chocolate fudgy notes and spicy spirit.  The glow in my mouth lingers for many long minutes, decaying into oak and toffee coffee bittersweet.

I could drink it every day.  Comparable quality in Scotch whiskey or French Cognac would cost multiples of what you get for less than a U.S. Grant note here in the US.

Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion.

Having a product that gives a pleasant taste to water seems like a great idea.  Somewhere between the execution of that great idea and the actual Mio product, is reality.<br /><br />We all perceive tastes and smells differently, having thousands of receptors in our mouths, noses, and on our tongues.  Our enjoyment or dislike of a product varies, based on those receptors.  Remember too, that we `eat with our eyes' before we taste anything.<br /><br />Using ½ teaspoon of the concentrate in eight ounces of water (very cold with ice), here are my impressions of this water enhancer:<br />Eyes:  it looks like a light brown color for tea.  Home-brewed teas (except for white, green or, fruit teas) have a darker color.  This one has a touch of pinkish beige to it.<br />Nose:  It has the scent of a weak tea.<br /><br />Mouth:  the first sensation is sweetness, not at all cloying.  I don't get a strong flavor at all.  I add another half teaspoon.  The color deepens.  Instead of tasting more tea, I get more sweetness, not a bolder tea flavor.  I don't add more drops, as I don't want a sweeter flavor--just a stronger tea taste.  In comparison to a popular brand, to which a small tub of tea powder and artificial sweetener is added, this one is lacking.<br /><br />The container is small enough to slip into a handbag, briefcase or, backpack.  The directions call for a half-teaspoon measurement.  It would be easier to have the liquid dispense in drops that could be squeezed from the bottle so, instead of guessing as to exact measurement, the number of drops would be more precise.<br /><br />If used according to the package's directions, this little vial contains 24 servings.  It's certainly convenient to be able to turn a glass of water--or a bottle--into a tasty beverage.  Amazon offers a four-pack (and a single vial option).  Together, they make 96 flavored glasses of water.  That's a tremendous savings if you were to buy the equivalent in bottles of flavored water.<br /><br />Please note that this product contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.  It also contains dyes.<br /><br />Since we rely on our own senses to rate taste, you may want to buy the single container and judge it for yourself.",neutral,19,218,0.9868,positive,negative,neutral,de,MIXED

He eats this food happily but it doesn't agree with his tummy which doesn't make me too happy. His abundant paw licking isn't because this dog food was paw-licking good, his food sensitivity/allergy has returned.

This tasted great on a full plate of rice and made 6 large servings- creating an all-in-one dish and cost effective. If you want something crunchy, small pieces of celery would do fine. If you would prefer something soft, you can use a can of straw mushrooms.<br /><br />I prefer to cut vegetables into 1/3"" cubes and meat into 3/4"" strips so that every forkful has all the ingredients when the sauce is potent like this one.

Fancy Feast says the Appetizers should supplement regular cat food rather than replace it. But it's the one meal that gets my cat to clean his bowl.<br /><br />So when I discovered Soulistic cat foods being offered at Petco, I gave the Sweet Salutations Chicken and Tuna Dinner a try.

This Splenda With B Vitamins to help support a healthy metobolism does supply 20% of B Vitamins B1, B5 and B6 per packet.  I wish it also included B12, but it doesn't. That is a fair amount of B Vitamins from one packet.  I guess you really can't ask for anymore from one packet of a no calorie sweetener.<br /><br />The box has 80 packets, which is kind of odd, because I buy the regular Splenda in a box of 100 packets.  Not sure why this variety only has 80 packets, as the packets aren't any larger than the regular Splenda.  Each packet sweetens like 2 teaspoons of sugar. I added one packet to one large cup of hot tea.  It was just sweet enough, not to sweet.<br /><br />The Splenda Essentials line also comes in a fiber variety, as well as an antioxidant variety. I do like that this comes in separate packets to take on the go, as some restaurants do not have Splenda.<br /><br />Iam trying to cut down on my sugar intake due to an increase in my glucose level.  I have to say that Splenda is the most natural tasting no calorie sweetener.  I have tried Stevia but it has a weird taste to me.<br /><br />I like that you can use Splenda in a hot or cold beverage, as regular sugar doesn't desolve in a cold beverage.<br /><br />I really don't eat cereal with milk or fruit with sugar, but Iam sure this Splenda would work for that too, and foods like that.<br /><br />If you are trying to cut down on your sugar intake for whatever reason this Splenda with B Vitamins might be a good sugar alternative for you.

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products.

According to my Swedish friends, Swedish Duty Free shops were the ONLY place to buy this treasure. Thus, as an American I've been mostly deprived of it over the past five years.

I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped, there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you're eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results.",neutral,4,67,0.7501,positive,negative,neutral,normal,MIXED

They have a sweet pepperoni favor (I haven't tried the smoked favor yet).  They are almost a foot long and ½ inch across.  Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, the sticks I got are moist and soft, not dry and chalky.  Perhaps I was just lucky.  They taste and have a texture just like their meat counterparts.

They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag.
